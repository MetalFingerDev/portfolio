# utils/math

Purpose: Math helpers and numerical utilities used across the project.

---

## Overview

Pure helper functions for calculations, unit conversions, and common numerical utilities.

## Usage 💡

Import utilities directly where needed. Prefer small, pure functions and add tests for numerical stability.

## Development 🔧

- Add unit tests for edge cases and floating-point behavior.

## Notes (2026-01-18)

- The main loop includes logic that computes object displacement between frames (used for camera lock-on), so utilities for vector math and small epsilon-safe comparisons may be useful here.

## Contributing ✨

Document any non-obvious numeric decisions and include references when appropriate.
